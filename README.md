# Decision Tree Algorithm
### Decision Tree Algorithm for Breast Cancer Dataset

This repository contains an implementation of the Decision Tree algorithm for classifying breast cancer data. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which is a popular dataset for machine learning tasks related to cancer detection.

## Overview

The Decision Tree algorithm is a supervised learning technique used for classification and regression tasks. In this repository, we use the Decision Tree algorithm to classify breast cancer data into malignant or benign categories based on various features. Here we implemented decision tree using both criterion : Entropy and Gini-index. Tree Representation is also added.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset, which you can directly load from sci-kit datasets. It is also available in the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).


## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib` (optional, for visualization)
